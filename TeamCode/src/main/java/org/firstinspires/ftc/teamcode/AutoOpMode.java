/*
 * This OpMode illustrates using a camera to locate and drive towards a specific AprilTag.
 * The code assumes a basic two-wheel Split Arcade Robot Drivetrain
 *
 * For an introduction to AprilTags, see the ftc-docs link below:
 * https://ftc-docs.firstinspires.org/en/latest/apriltag/vision_portal/apriltag_intro/apriltag-intro.html
 *
 * When an AprilTag in the TagLibrary is detected, the SDK provides location and orientation of the tag, relative to the camera.
 * This information is provided in the "ftcPose" member of the returned "detection", and is explained in the ftc-docs page linked below.
 * https://ftc-docs.firstinspires.org/apriltag-detection-values
 *
 * The driving goal is to rotate to keep the tag centered in the camera, while driving towards the tag to achieve the desired distance.
 * To reduce any motion blur (which will interrupt the detection process) the Camera exposure is reduced to a very low value (5mS)
 * You can determine the best exposure and gain values by using the ConceptAprilTagOptimizeExposure OpMode in this Samples folder.
 *
 * The code assumes a Robot Configuration with motors named leftDrive and rightDrive.
 * The motor directions must be set so a positive power goes forward on both wheels;
 * This sample assumes that the default AprilTag Library (usually for the current season) is being loaded by default
 * so you should choose to approach a valid tag ID (usually starting at 0)
 *
 * Under manual control, the left stick will move forward/back, and the right stick will rotate the robot.
 * This is called POV Joystick mode, different than Tank Drive (where each joystick controls a wheel).
 *
 * Manually drive the robot until it displays Target data on the Driver Station.
 * Press and hold the *Left Bumper* to enable the automatic "Drive to target" mode.
 * Release the Left Bumper to return to manual driving mode.
 *
 *  Under "Drive To Target" mode, the robot has two goals:
 *  1) Turn the robot to always keep the Tag centered on the camera frame. (Use the Target Bearing to turn the robot.)
 *  2) Drive towards the Tag to get to the desired distance.  (Use Tag Range to drive the robot forward/backward)
 *
 *  Use DESIRED_DISTANCE to set how close you want the robot to get to the target.
 * Speed and Turn sensitivity can be adjusted using the AUTO_SPEED_GAIN and AUTO_TURN_GAIN constants.
 *
 * Use Android Studio to Copy this Class, and Paste it into the TeamCode/src/main/java/org/firstinspires/ftc/teamcode folder.
 * Remove or comment out the @Disabled line to add this OpMode to the Driver Station OpMode list.
